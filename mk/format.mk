# formats to a different standard than the last one did.

## Indent all C, shell, and Python files in-place
#
# shfmt and black are opt-in, unlike clang-format and commentflow. Those two are
# pinned (LINT_PKGS in .github/workflows/lint.yml, and commentflow by checksum)
# and check-format verifies what they write, so running them is idempotent
# against the tree. shfmt and black are neither pinned nor checked: CI installs
# shellcheck, which lints shell but does not format it, and nothing looks at
# Python formatting at all. Their output tracks whichever version the developer
# happens to have, so running them unconditionally rewrites files no gate asked
# to change. Measured on shfmt 3.14.0 and black 26.5.1 against cfc696e: one
# shell script and one Python script, both of which check-format accepts either
# way, landing as unrelated churn in whatever diff was open.
#
# Set FORMAT_SHELL=1 / FORMAT_PY=1 to run them anyway. The other way out is to
# pin both in the workflow and add shfmt -l / black --check to check-format,
# which makes the pair inverse; that is a CI change and it has to land with the
# reformat it implies.
