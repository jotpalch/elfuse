#
# The run loop used to arm and disarm alarm() around every hv_vcpu_run, so the
# watchdog was a kernel timer covering exactly one iteration. It now arms one
# repeating timer and decides from a progress word the loop publishes, which
# trades two syscalls per guest syscall for slightly coarser detection: a tick
# that sees the word move records it and returns, so a hang is caught on the
# second tick rather than the first.
#
# That is a real behavior change to elfuse's only defence against a wedged
# guest, and nothing else in the suite exercises it. This lane does:
#
#   - a guest spinning in EL0 with no syscalls must be killed, and within two
#     periods rather than hanging or being killed immediately
#   - a guest that blocks for longer than a period in a host syscall must NOT be
#     killed, because a blocking syscall is not a wedged guest (the loop is
#     outside hv_vcpu_run, so the tick records progress instead of firing)
#   - --timeout 0 must disable the watchdog entirely

# Detection takes two ticks: the first records the progress word, the second
# sees it unchanged and fires. The bound is three periods rather than two so a
# loaded host does not flake, which leaves exactly one period of jitter; six, as
# this once allowed, would have passed a regression that took five. One period
# of slack is also thin: the observed time is 4 s of a 6 s bound on an idle
# host, and this is a make check gate. A busy host turns that slack into a false
# failure rather than a finding, so the bound stays tight and an overrun is
# reported as a skip when the load explains it. The load is sampled at the mark
# before the timed run and again at the branch, because a host that was loaded
# during the run and idle by the time the verdict is read would otherwise turn a
# load artifact into a failure. driver.sh, test-sharun.sh and test-runner.sh use
# the same pair for the same reason. Strictly above one period, not at or above
# it. A kill on the first tick is the regression this bound exists to catch, and
# it lands at exactly PERIOD, so the old "at or above" form could not fail:
# every kill passes it. Two periods would be the exact expectation, but elapsed
# is whole seconds from date(1), so a correct run that straddles a second
# boundary can read one low; strictly-greater separates a first-tick kill from a
# two-tick one with a full period of margin either side.
