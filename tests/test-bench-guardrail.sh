# Hot-syscall performance guardrail
#
# Runs bench-hot-guard (musl-static) and, when the cross-glibc toolchain is
# available, bench-hot-guard-glibc (dynamic glibc) under elfuse, then enforces
# limits on four hot paths:
#
#   getpid                <= 200 ns/op    (shim identity fast path)
#   clock_gettime(libc)   <=  50 ns/op    (vDSO CNTVCT fast path)
#   read(/dev/urandom, 1) <= 400 ns/op    (shim urandom ring fast path)
#   FUTEX_WAIT (word moved) <= 400 ns/op  (shim futex fast path)
#   stat("/dev/null")     <= Nx getpid    (guest_read_path, no fast path)
#   read(empty nonblocking pipe) <= Nx getpid   (per-transfer overhead)
#   pipe write+read       <= Nx getpid    (transfer plus wait/wakeup)
#
# The first three are absolute; every other lane is a ratio to a getpid from the
# same run. See the threshold block below for why the two kinds of limit are not
# interchangeable.
#
# The static (musl) bench is the baseline; the dynamic-glibc bench verifies that
# glibc 2.41's vDSO probe (NT_GNU_ABI_TAG PT_NOTE) keeps clock_gettime on the
# trampolines instead of trapping. When LINUX_TOOLCHAIN is missing the glibc
# variant skips cleanly.

# Absolute ceilings for the three shim/vDSO-served lanes. The wide headroom is
# deliberate and matches what these lanes actually check: each is served inline
# and regresses as a step function, not a slope. Losing the shim identity path
# takes getpid from ~50 ns to SVC time, and losing vDSO acceptance takes
# clock_gettime from ~5 ns to ~2000 ns. Both blow past any of these numbers, so
# tightening them buys nothing and only risks flaking on slower CI hardware.
# read-urandom1 keeps the widest margin of the three: on a loaded laptop it was
# observed up to ~280 ns/op across sequential runs, while an SVC bail lands past
# 1000 ns, so 400 separates them without chasing load noise.

# futex-eagain is the same shape as the two above and takes the same ceiling.
# Served at EL1 it measures ~51 ns, level with getpid; a bail to the host lands
# at the HVC floor, ~2000 ns on an idle host and higher under load. 400 sits an
# order of magnitude clear of the served value and well under the bail, so it
# catches "the fast path stopped being taken" without tracking load. Paired with
# tests/test-shim-futex-stats.sh, which asserts the path ran at all: that lane
# catches a dispatch that stops reaching it, this one catches a slowdown that
# still reaches it.
THRESH_FUTEX=400

# stat-path is checked as a ratio to getpid from the same run, not as an
# absolute figure. It is the only lane whose cost is a slope: it scales with
# what the guest-copy helpers charge per call, so it regresses by a percentage
# rather than by falling off a fast path. An absolute ceiling cannot catch that
# without being tuned to one machine. Dividing by getpid, measured on the same
# hardware moments earlier, cancels the machine out.
#
# The number this exists to catch: arming the SIGBUS recovery pad with sigsetjmp
# instead of _setjmp added two sigprocmask traps per guest copy and took stat
# from 4.2 us to 6.1 us, a ratio of 84 to 122. It tripped no ceiling here,
# because this lane did not exist.
#
# Observed 84 static and 407 dynamic, both within 3% across runs. The dynamic
# arm is 5x the static one because sysroot redirection resolves every path
# component. Ceilings sit ~1.25x over observed.
#
# The static arm is the detector. Restoring the sigsetjmp regression moves it 82
# -> 125, comfortably past 105, while the dynamic arm moved only 407 -> 488 and
# slipped under its ceiling on one run: sysroot resolution is so much of that
# 13.6 us that a per-copy cost is diluted to noise. Keep the dynamic arm for
# gross regressions, do not tighten it toward 450 chasing the small ones, and do
# not read a dynamic pass as evidence the copy helpers are clean.
THRESH_STAT_RATIO_STATIC=105
THRESH_STAT_RATIO_GLIBC=500

# The two transfer lanes, both ratios to getpid for the same reason stat-path
# is: they are host calls whose cost is a slope, and dividing by a lane measured
# on the same machine moments earlier cancels the machine out.
#
# pipe-eagain is the detector. A read of an empty pipe the guest set nonblocking
# reaches the fd lookup, the block-state decision and the transfer attempt, then
# returns without touching the pipe buffer or waking anything, so it measures
# per-transfer overhead and nothing else. Observed 52-66 across runs on a loaded
# machine, a 25% spread, which is tight enough to gate at 85.
#
# The number this exists to catch: read/write on a fd that can block used to
# probe with poll(), divert to the slow path when the probe said "not ready",
# and re-resolve the fd there. Measured on this lane at 259-857 against 52-66
# after that divert was removed. Anything that puts a host call or a lock
# acquisition back into the per-transfer path lands in the same range, and the
# guardrail had no lane that could see it: a 30-50% regression in the read/write
# path passed this script clean while it was being written.
#
# pipe-roundtrip moves a byte out and back, so it covers the wait and wakeup
# machinery pipe-eagain skips. It also inherits the scheduler noise that comes
# with them: observed 77-176 on the same runs where pipe-eagain held a 25%
# spread. It is a gross-regression arm, kept for the coverage and ceilinged so
# it does not flake. Do not tighten it toward the observed median chasing small
# regressions, and do not read a pass here as evidence the transfer path is
# clean; that is pipe-eagain's job.
THRESH_PIPE_EAGAIN_RATIO=85
THRESH_PIPE_RT_RATIO=220

# The same transfer with a sibling thread alive, divided by getpid from that
# same state, so the pair isolates what a second thread costs and nothing else.
# It is not a duplicate of pipe-eagain: with one active thread elfuse borrows
# the host fd, and with a sibling it dups and closes it around every fd syscall
# to keep a racing close from retiring it. That is two host syscalls a guest
# doing real work pays on every read and write, measured at 47.8x against 58.3x
# here, and no single-threaded lane can see it. Ceiled at 110 so the dup pair
# has room but a third host call does not.
THRESH_PIPE_EAGAIN_MT_RATIO=110

# Bulk transfer: a megabyte written into a pipe a sibling drains, so the write
# fills the buffer, waits, and resumes. Every other lane moves one byte, which
# is why the ready-poll rewrite could leave bulk writes 21-31% slower with
# nothing here to notice.
#
# This lane is a gross-regression arm, and the ceiling says so. It cannot catch
# the regression that motivated it: idle it measures ~6900x, a busy host alone
# put it at 9900x, and a 25% regression would read ~8600x -- inside the band
# load produces on its own. Bulk throughput is dominated by pipe capacity and
# scheduling rather than by syscall entry cost, so dividing by getpid does not
# cancel the load the way it does for stat-path. A tighter number here would
# fail on clean trees and be ignored, which costs more than it catches.
#
# What catches a 25% slope is the A/B in the TODO entry: two builds, alternating
# passes, medians, on an idle machine. The lane's job is to make that comparison
# possible at all by existing.
#
# The ceiling is 15000 against an idle figure near 6900, which is 2.17x: it
# trips just short of a 2.2x collapse, and lets a 2x one through. It is written
# that way because a busy host alone reached 1.4x, and the gap between the two
# is the whole margin this lane has: a number tight enough to catch 2x would
# fail on clean trees.
THRESH_PIPE_BULK_RATIO=15000

# Descriptor creation, with and without path resolution. fd_init_entry stats the
# host fd and may set O_NONBLOCK on it inside the fd-table lock; pipe-create is
# the same allocation with the path work removed, so the pair says how much of
# the cost is resolution.
#
# fd-create splits by variant for the same reason stat-path does: under dynamic
# glibc the open resolves through the sysroot, which is most of the lane. It
# measured 999x against a first-cut 1000x ceiling, which would have flaked on
# the next busy run rather than caught anything. pipe-create allocates without a
# path, so one number covers both.
