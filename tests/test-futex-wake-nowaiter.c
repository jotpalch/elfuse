 *
 * elfuse answers a wake with no waiter from EL1, off a per-bucket count the
 * wait paths publish. Two things have to hold and only one of them is obvious.
 *
 * The obvious one is the ABI: a wake on an address nobody waits on returns 0,
 * including for an unmapped address, and a malformed one still returns EINVAL.
 *
 * The other is that the count may never read zero while a waiter is on its way
 * to parking, because the answer would then be 0 for a waiter that is still
 * there and the wakeup is lost. The stress below is built to sit in that
 * window: each round starts a waiter and wakes it from another thread with no
 * synchronization between the two beyond the futex itself, so the wake lands
 * before, during and after the wait across enough rounds. A regression here
 * does not fail an assertion, it hangs, which is why the harness timeout is the
 * real assertion.
 *
 * Every assertion is plain Linux futex ABI, so the reference kernel adjudicates
 * this file unchanged.
