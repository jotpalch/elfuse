/*
 * test-ptrace-interrupt.c -- what PTRACE_INTERRUPT shows when it lands in the
 * EL1 shim.
 *
 * Copyright 2026 elfuse contributors
 * SPDX-License-Identifier: Apache-2.0
 *
 * PTRACE_INTERRUPT kicks the tracee out of hv_vcpu_run. The kick can land while
 * the tracee is inside an EL1 fast path rather than in EL0 code, and there the
 * live registers are the shim's scratch: the guest's own values are in the
 * saved SVC frame and ELR_EL1 holds the EL0 return the shim still means to ERET
 * through. A stop taken from that state reports scratch through
 * PTRACE_GETREGSET and discards what PTRACE_SETREGSET writes, because the shim
 * restores its frame over it on the way out.
 *
 * The tracee here does nothing but calls the shim answers inline: getpid off
 * the identity cache and a 256-byte urandom read off the entropy ring. Neither
 * reaches the host and neither can block, so the thread is only ever in EL0 or
 * inside the shim, which is what gives the kick somewhere useful to land.
 *
 * Two things are checked at every stop. The reported PC has to be an EL0
 * address, not a shim one: the shim lives just under the interpreter base, at
 * 60 GiB on a 36-bit IPA and 1020 GiB on a 40-bit one, and this guest's own
 * text is under 4 GiB. And the tracee keeps a known value in x21, a
 * callee-saved register its loop never writes, so a snapshot of shim scratch
 * shows something else there.
 *
 * This is an elfuse-internal test. PTRACE_SEIZE of a thread in the caller's own
 * thread group fails with EPERM on Linux, so the reference kernel cannot
 * adjudicate the shape, and what is under test is elfuse's own register
 * snapshot rather than a kernel behavior. The penultimate stop also changes
 * x21, which the final snapshot verifies survived PTRACE_CONT. The tracee
 * signals itself throughout, so a share of the kicks are consumed on the
 * rt_sigreturn tail, which returns on host-rebuilt state.
