 * epoll_ctl(2) reports EPERM from the target alone: a target with no poll
 * support is refused whatever the event mask asks for, and a target that never
 * becomes writable still accepts EPOLLOUT. macOS kqueue disagrees in both
 * directions. It refuses a knote on a directory or a character device, refuses
 * EVFILT_WRITE on a kqueue (which is what a timerfd and a nested epoll fd are
 * here), and accepts one on a plain file that Linux refuses. This pins all
 * three against src/syscall/poll.c sys_epoll_ctl.
 *
 * Syscalls exercised: epoll_create1(20), epoll_ctl(21), epoll_pwait(22),
 *                     openat(56), close(57), pipe2(59),
 *                     timerfd_create(85), timerfd_settime(86)
