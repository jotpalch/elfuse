 *
 * Code under test: the ours/not-ours decision in src/runtime/usb-sysfs.c
 * (classify_and_normalize + usb_resolve_or_disown), the getdents64 union in
 * src/syscall/fs.c, the access arm of sys_faccessat, and the fd-side sysfs
 * identity in sys_fstatfs (src/syscall/fs-stat.c).
 *
 * The layer synthesizes exactly one subtree on each side, /sys/bus/usb and
 * /dev/bus/usb, on top of a backing /sys and /dev/bus that a sysroot supplies.
 * Its contract is not per-syscall: a name is this layer's or it is not, and
 * every entry point has to answer from that one decision. Four regressions all
 * came from an entry point re-deriving it -- lstat/open(O_NOFOLLOW)/readlink
 * shadowed the backing because their resolve succeeded where stat's failed,
 * getdents64 replaced the backing listing instead of extending it, /dev/bus had
 * no fall-through arm at all while access(2) fell through anyway, and fstatfs
 * never saw the sysfs identity statfs was handing out. Pinning them one
 * assertion at a time is what let them appear, so this is a matrix instead:
 * every entry point against every path class, so a fix that unifies one pair
 * and splits another cannot pass.
 *
 * EXPECTED VALUES ARE MEASURED, NOT ASSUMED. Every cell below was recorded by
 * running this same binary natively on Linux (docker gcc:14, aarch64, kernel
 * 6.x) with MATRIX_RECORD=1, over a /sys that is a real sysfs and a /dev/bus
 * carrying a mknod'd usb node next to a foreign bus directory. Re-record with:
 *
 *   docker run --rm -v "$PWD:/w" -w /w gcc:14 sh -c \
 *     'mkdir -p /dev/bus/usb/001 /dev/bus/other && : > /dev/bus/other/f && \
 *      mknod /dev/bus/usb/001/001 c 189 0 && \
 *      gcc -D MATRIX_STANDALONE -o /tmp/m tests/test-usb-sysfs-matrix.c && \
 *      MATRIX_RECORD=1 /tmp/m'
 *
 * Cells the guest cannot match byte-for-byte are recorded per class rather than
 * per spelling; see the notes on COL_SUBSYS and COL_NODE.
