"""Fail when a C source file carries non-ASCII outside the diagram set.

The convention is ASCII prose. The tree needs one carve-out: the flow diagrams
several headers carry are worth more than the rule they break, and they need
the Box Drawing block to be readable at all. Everything else outside ASCII
fails, which is the half that had no enforcement before: an em dash, a smart
quote, an ellipsis, a non-breaking space, an arrow, a zero-width joiner.

Scope is the C family under src, tests and frama-c-stubs. Shell is left out on
purpose: scripts/test-git-hooks.sh carries an em dash as the fixture that proves
the commit-message hook rejects one, so a gate over .sh would fail on a file
whose whole job is to contain the character.

Python rather than grep: BSD grep has no -P, so the codepoint escapes the
convention documents match nothing on a stock macOS runner and report a clean
tree.
