 * LINUX_MAX_ARG_STRLEN is the kernel's MAX_ARG_STRLEN, 32 pages on a 4 KiB

 * an unbounded host allocation; the entry count shares MAX_ARG_STRLEN's value
 * by coincidence, not by derivation, which is why it is named separately.
 *
 * Shared rather than per-file: read_string_array (src/syscall/exec.c) enforces
 * the count while building the arrays, build_linux_stack (src/core/stack.c)
 * enforces it again while pushing them, and src/proved/stack.h states the
 * containment argument for STACK_MAX_WORDS in terms of it. Three copies of the
 * number let a change to one leave the other two disagreeing in silence.
