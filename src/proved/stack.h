 *
 * build_linux_stack lays out argc/argv/envp/auxv exactly as fs/binfmt_elf.c
 * does, and two things there are easy to get wrong and hard to see wrong. The
 * string region walks down from stack_top by a guest-controlled number of
 * guest-controlled lengths, and the structured area must leave SP 16-byte
 * aligned AND pointing directly at argc, with no gap. A libc that finds either
 * wrong does not fail cleanly; it reads argv from the wrong offset.
 *
 * Split out of stack.c because stack.c cannot be given to Frama-C: it includes
 * core/guest.h and syscall/proc.h, which pull in Hypervisor.framework. This
 * header needs nothing but stdint.h, so make verify-stack proves it directly.
 *
 * The descent is already contained today: read_string_array
 * (src/syscall/exec.c) caps combined argv/envp bytes at ELFUSE_MAX_ARG_BYTES
 * and the entry count at ELFUSE_MAX_ARG_STRINGS, against an 8 MiB stack.
 * Routing every step through stack_take makes that containment structural, held
 * by a postcondition here rather than by two caps in another file staying
 * smaller than the stack.
